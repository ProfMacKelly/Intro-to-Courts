# Brief: Chimel v. California

**Facts**&#x20;

* Police officers, armed with an **arrest warrant for Chimel for burglary, arrived at his home**. Chimel's **wife allowed them inside**. (Chimel was not there, and officers waited.)
* When Chimel arrived, **he was arrested.**&#x20;
* Conducted an extensive search of the entire three-bedroom house, including the attic, garage, and workshop.&#x20;
* Search was about one hour
  * involved the officers directing Chimel's wife to move items in drawers so they could view anything connected to the burglary.&#x20;
  * Numerous items, primarily coins, were seized and later used as evidence to convict Chimel on burglary charges.

**Issue** Did the warrantless search of Chimelâ€™s entire house, conducted incident to a lawful arrest, violate his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures?

**Holding:** Yes.&#x20;

The search of Chimel's entire house was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The **scope of a search incident to a lawful arrest is limited to the arrestee's person and the area within his immediate control.**

**Rule:**&#x20;

* Search incident to (lawful) arrest are an exception to warrant requirement
  * The permissible **scope** of a search incident to a lawful arrest extends **only to the arrestee's person and the area within his immediate control**
    * i.e., the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.&#x20;

**Reasoning**&#x20;

* A broad exception to the warrant requirement based on search incident to arrest:
  * **inconsistent** with the Fourth Amendment's purpose of protecting individuals from unreasonable intrusions into their privacy.&#x20;
  * Importance of the warrant requirement, stating that **"the burden is on those seeking \[an] exemption \[from the requirement] to show the need for it."**&#x20;
  * Justification: (1) officer safety and (2) preventing the destruction of evidence
  * limited to the area within the arrestee's immediate control.&#x20;
