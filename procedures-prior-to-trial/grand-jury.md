# Grand Jury

A [grand jury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/grand_jury) is:

> a group of people selected to sit on a[ jury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jury) that decide whether the [prosecutor’s](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prosecutor) evidence provides [probable cause](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/probable_cause) to issue an[ indictment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/indictment). An indictment formally charges a person with committing a [crime](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/crime) and begins the criminal [prosecution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prosecution) process.

The process to establish a grand jury begins when a judge issues an order, usually at the district attorney's request, to assemble a grand jury list. This list, comprising 75 to 150 individuals, is compiled confidentially and must adhere to a set timeframe.

The selection process for a grand jury should align with the methods used for petit juries (i.e., trial juries). When potential jurors convene, the judge assesses their eligibility, possibly with input from the prosecuting officer. Inadequate panels undergo further selection until at least seventeen qualified jurors are present.

Grand jurors serve for thirty-one days, extended if necessary for ongoing proceedings. Non-compliance with statutory impaneling procedures only affects the validity of the indictment if it likely prejudiced the accused.

Discrimination in juror service on the basis of personal attributes like sex, race, religion, or sexual orientation, among others, is prohibited. Grand jurors swear to secrecy, appointing a presiding juror and a clerk among themselves to manage documentation. Sessions require a minimum of fourteen jurors to proceed, with indictments needing at least twelve jurors' agreement.

Jurors must attend all sessions unless excused for a valid reason by the presiding juror, facing fines for unwarranted absences. Various rules govern the proceedings, including documentation filing and court supervision. Unlike petit juries, grand juries are empowered to interpret both law and facts independently.

Upon dissolution, the grand jury clerk is responsible for delivering all records to an authorized official, ensuring their security and confidentiality.
