## Analysis

* 4th: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”
* Purpose: Protection against invasions allowed by general warrants and other protections that existed in England
  * So, fundamental 4th Amend principle: a man’s house was his castle and not to be invaded by any general authority to search and seize his goods and papers.&#x20;
  * &#x20;“no man’s house can be forcibly opened, or he or his goods be carried away after it has thus been forced, except in cases of felony, and then the sheriff must be furnished with a warrant, and take great care lest he commit a trespass.&#x20;
  *   &#x20;Fourth and Fifth Amendments, said:

      > It was in that case demonstrated that both of these Amendments contemplated perpetuating, in their full efficacy, by means of a constitutional provision, principles of humanity and civil liberty, which had been secured in the mother country only after years of struggle, so as to implant them in our institutions in the fullness of their integrity, free from the possibilities of future legislative change.

      * place limitations and restraints on federal gov't powers and authoriy
* **when legally arrested, gov't may searched the person and seize the fruits (of the search) or evidence of crime**
* **If warrantless searches were allowed, the 4th Amend would be meaningless**
  * **Fundamental principle!**
* **Need to protect the "sanctity" of one's home**
